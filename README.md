#Overview
Crazyflie-noetic collects different ROS packages, which are all aimed to control both a real Crazyflie 2.1 and a 
simulated
one. Thanks to these packages it is also possible to control a real/simulated swarm as well. There are two types of 
packages:
* **custom packages**;
* **third party packages**;

**custom packages** collect all packages created from scratch, designed to be used with ROS Noetic and Python3
(tested with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS); while **third party packages** collect some third party packages working with older 
version of ROS (like [CrazyS](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS)), partially modified in order to make them work with 
ROS Noetic. Third party packages have not been fully tested, since finally they have not been further developed.

## Custom packages
### crazy_common_py
This package collects all the Python modules shared within the framework: classes, data types, functions and constants.
For further details see [crazy_common_py](https://github.com/AndreaFuso/Crazyflie-noetic/tree/main/crazy_common_py/src)
